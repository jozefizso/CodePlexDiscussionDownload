# CodePlexDiscussionDownload
CodePlexDiscussionDownload is a small utility application written in C# to download HTML and data from CodePlex Discusssion Forum.  The app scrapes the CodePlex Discussions downloading static HTML files of the thread list and thread details pages as well as extracting raw data and saving in a JSON format.

CodePlex is shutting down but the initial announcement indicates that a project's Discussions forum will not be included in the archived content.  [It looks like CodePlex may include that content](https://codeplex.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Moving%20CodePlex%20to%20read-only): 

> We've heard your feedback and are working to try and include discussions in that archive as well.

However, if they don't come through this utility can download the Discussions HTML and also extract some of the raw data to save in JSON format so that it can be used later (e.g. queries, expose via REST etc.).

## Configuration

Configuration is set via the configuration file (app.config=>CodePlexDiscussionDownload.exe.config)

``` xml
  <appSettings>
    <!-- comma separated list of Forums to download.  Required. -->
    <add key="codePlexForums" value="compositewpf" />
    <!-- Page size to use for listing forum threads. Optional. Default is 100. -->
    <add key="pageSize" value="100" />
    <!-- Output folder to use when writing threads. Default is output. -->
    <add key="outputFolder" value="output"/>
    <!-- Log file to write results to. Results will also be written to the console. If this entry is null or missing then no log file will be created. -->
    <add key="logFileName" value="codeplex_discussion_download.log"></add>
  </appSettings>
```

codePlexForums is the name of the project based on the site url.  e.g. For the URL of http://compositewpf.codeplex.com use compositewpf.

# Output
## Folder Structure
The app will create a directory in the outputFolder.  

* Each thread listing page will be saved in the form of index_0.html...index_99.html
* Details pages will be saved as an index.html in a subfolder corresponding to the ID of the discussion thread (e.g. /142241/index.html)
* The raw JSON data will be saved in a file in the form {forum}.json (e.g. compositewpf.json)

Here is a small example of a folder structure
```
C:.
├───output
│   ├───compositewpf
│   │   │   compositewpf.json
│   │   │   index_0.html
│   │   │   index_1.html
│   │   │   index_2.html
│   │   │   index_3.html
│   │   │   
│   │   ├───100423
│   │   │       index.html
│   │   │       
│   │   ├───137452
│   │   │       index.html
│   │   │       
│   │   ├───155429
│   │   │       index.html
│   │   │       
│   │   ├───155489
│   │   │       index.html
│   │   │       
```

## JSON Format
Here is a sample of the raw JSON data:

``` json
[{
	"Id": "657365",
	"DiscussionDate": "Aug 23, 2016",
	"Time": "10:01 AM",
	"Title": "Region navigate to NonShared view/viewmodel",
	"AuthorUsername": "gan_s",
	"Posts": [{
		"Id": "1481868",
		"DiscussionThreadId": "657365",
		"DateTime": "8/23/2016 9:52:56 AM",
		"Username": "gan_s",
		"Content": "\r\n        <div class=\"markDownOutput \">Hi, <br>\r\nI'm trying to create multiple tabs in a tabcontrol. Each tabItem will be View.xaml with a ViewModel. I have set the PartCreationPolicy for both the view and the viewmodel to be NonShared. My viewmodel implements INavigationAware. I have a TabControlRegionAdapter\r\n defined as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever when I do a regionManager.RequestNavigate to the view it seems to create only 1 instance of the view and viewmodel. I'm not sure how I should get the view and viewmodel to create a new instance for every tab item I create. Any help here will be much\r\n appreciated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm using Prism 4.1.0.0 with MEF. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanesh<br>\r\n</div>\r\n        \r\n    "
	}, {
		"Id": "1481870",
		"DiscussionThreadId": "657365",
		"DateTime": "8/23/2016 10:01:59 AM",
		"Username": "gan_s",
		"Content": "\r\n        <div class=\"markDownOutput \">Never mind...resolved this by setting IsNavigationTarget to return false. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanesh<br>\r\n</div>\r\n        \r\n    "
	}]
},]
```
## Caveats
In addition to the raw JSON data, this app downloads the raw HTML generated by CodePlex.  Note that this HTML is still quite CodePlex specific.  e.g. links point to CodePlex, images and styles are not present, etc.  Because of this, the generated HTML is not suitable initially for deploying to another website.  However, with a little global search/replace the generated HTML can be converted.

## Example Site
You can find a site created from this app at https://randylevy.github.io/UnityCodePlexForum/ .  The HTML source for the site can be found at https://github.com/randylevy/UnityCodePlexForum/ and useful images and styles can be found in that repo: https://github.com/randylevy/UnityCodePlexForum/tree/master/assets.
